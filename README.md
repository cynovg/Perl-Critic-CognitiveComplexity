# NAME

Perl::Critic::CognitiveComplexity - Cognitive Complexity, Because Testability != Understandability

# DESCRIPTION

Perl::Critic::Policy::CognitiveComplexity::ProhibitExcessCognitiveComplexity is a rule that checks the
cognitive complexity score of your subroutines. It is based on a new scoring algorithm introduced by
SonarSource. See https://blog.sonarsource.com/cognitive-complexity-because-testability-understandability/

## Complexity

- [CognitiveComplexity::ProhibitExcessCognitiveComplexity](https://metacpan.org/pod/Perl::Critic::Policy::CognitiveComplexity::ProhibitExcessCognitiveComplexity)
